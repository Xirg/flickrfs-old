  CVS - 
      - bugfix: SF bug 1352527: unhandled exception in thread during startup
      - bugfix: generalized fix for thread crashes which logs the traceback from the crash.
      - bugfix: turn unicode strings from flickrfs into utf8.
      - bugfix: supply auth to photoset call so that non-public photosets are listed.
      - feature: use 'last update' as mtime and 'date uploaded' as ctime.
      - bugfix: supply auth in streams_thread so non-public photos are listed.
      - bugfix: supply auth in tags_thread/personal dir so non-public photos are listed.
      - feature: public photos now also have metadata files.
      - bugfix: photos whose titles already end with the image extension no longer get an extra
            copy of the extenion name tacked on.
      - bugfix: fixed inability to retrieve certain photos.
      - bugfix: added missing import of 'sys' module (only used during certain error exits)
      - 20080127RDM bugfix: added fuse-python 0.2 compatibility by setting the
          python_fuse_api to 0.1.
      - 20080128RDM bugfix: use only one thread to populate photos in sets,
          rather than one thread per set.  This seems to fix the problem of
          having no photos appear when there are lots of sets.
      - 20080128RDM bugfix: handle the case of the photo not having an
          'originalformat' property in getPhotoInfo (default to jpg).
