1. Automatically resizing the photos to 800x600, 1024x728 etc. while
uploading. The user will specify which resolution the photos shd be
converted to through a 'config.txt' file located in flickrfs Home
directory. -DONE

2. Meta data - I have tested the editing of metadata files through sed, vim,
and gedit. But more tests need to be done on other editors, for e.g. nano,
xemacs

3. Sync any changes done directly to flickr with flickrfs (while its still
mounted obv). This will mean flickrfs can automatically detect any new
photos uploaded to flickr (directly), and show them. Also means, that any
change in meta-data will be reflected as well. Though search results i.e.
tags/public or tags/personal need not be affected (or even synced). -DONE

It wd be best to do this using a command rather than a time bound
recurring thread. This wd prevent any inconsistencies. 
  -I realized that a time bound method is more feasible. It doesn't
create any inconsistencies, and is effortless. Preferable. -Manish
