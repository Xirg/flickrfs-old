This test program unfortunately depends on the existence AND STATE of
a flickr account named 'flickrtester'.  The password to this account is
'testme'.

The code sets HOME to the test directory, so when you first run it it
will make you go through the log in process, but the info stored will
not affect your regular flickrfs account.  Likewise, the log file will
be in a subdirectory of the test directory.

Once you've run the script, you need to go on to the test account through
the flickr interface and delete the uploaded photo from the stream.
If you don't do this the test will fail the next time it is run.

If a test fails, 'Error:' and a message is printed on the console after
the test 'tag'.

To be sure all tests have passed successful, you must also check the
flickrfs log for any 'ERROR' messages.  A few errors do not cause the
tests to fail.


Existing bugs the code reports:

o Nothing shows up in tags/personal/flickrfstestest

o When the test set is deleted (during cleanup), an ERROR shows up in
    the flickrfs log that the set could not be found.


Known shortcomings of the current test set that I intend to fix:

o Does not unmount and remount the file system to check that the
    newly created image and set actually got uploaded

o Does not test creating an image with international characters

o Has not been checked to make sure it exercises all code paths.
    (this is a long term project)


Shortcomings I don't currently intend to fix (though I might
eventually):

o Dependence on a particular flickrfs test account and its state.

o Dependency on the results returned by particular public tag searches
